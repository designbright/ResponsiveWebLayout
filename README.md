*This project was completed as part of an immersive code academy cirriculum.* 

## The Elements of Responsive Web Design
Responsive Web Design has two interdependent elements:
* Media Queries
    * Media queries are CSS statements that allow us to contextualize styling.
    * Have breakpoints 
* Fluid Layouts
    * Used to manage what happens between the media queries. 
    * Creates a fluid transition when your screen size changes instead of a stark jump from desktop to mobile view
